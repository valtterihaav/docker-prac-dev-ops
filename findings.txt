Container share the OS information with the host machine. On top of this docker containers are built.
It also shares the host machine's storage capabilities. Meaning that how much there is free disk space etc. is
determined by the host machine hardware specifications. Also, Docker uses the machine's hardware to run its containers
meaning that on a low end machine it might take substantially longer to run Docker stuff.
